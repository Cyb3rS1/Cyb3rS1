üïπÔ∏è My background: 

I've been a student for nearly my entire life. Before I was a student, I was a young Mario Kart prodigy. Nintendo games were a considerable chunk of my curriculum before kindergarten. 
Instead of playing outside or with Barbie dolls, my hands were occupied by a Wii remote; if I had a chance to go back and change that, I wouldn't. The immersive exposure to technology and
video games exercised my critical thinking at a very young age. They were mainly wholesome puzzle games that took strategy and patience. Little did I know that that brief yet crucial phase of my early development would 
launch my learning ability and passion into a field of ever-increasing technological wonder.

üéá What gets me going:

I love digital art and technology! Toby Fox games like Undertale and Deltarune are concrete examples of wholesome, indie RPG games I thoroughly enjoy and hope to develop similar someday. 
(Including the games previously mentioned,) OMORI and DDLC inspire my personal art style and spark my love of story-rich games.
- You would probably think that I play video games all the time after reading about how much they inspire me; but the truth is, I never have time to play them. Well, I don't MAKE time to play them.
  Since I spend hours upon hours coding and doing online school work, my ideal downtime is usually away from a computer screen. Thankfully, my job will soon entail developing the things I don't have time for now ;)
